        The US Hershey’s Chocolate World Attraction is playing host to a number

        According to the business, its Pennsylvania centre has conjured up a
        host of limited-time treats for its visitors, with the site offering

        experience coming soon where guests can personalise a larger-than-life
        Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup with peanut butter direct from the factory
        with mix-ins of their choice. Guests can also visit Hershey’s Chocolate
        World’s iconic attractions including Hershey’s largest candy store, the
        free Hershey’s Chocolate Tour, chocolate tasting, a Create Your Own
        Candy Bar factory experience. There are also locations in New York’s

        Chocolate World is adding sweetness this year more than ever,” said Todd
        Kohr, Marketing Manager, Hershey’s Chocolate World Attraction. “From our
